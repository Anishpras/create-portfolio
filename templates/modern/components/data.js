For this project I wanted to push myself to understand using 3D on the web and how it can create engaging experiences.",

      "This was built for Pitt CSC Hacks, a competition sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh's Computer Science Club and was my first time participating in a coding competition. Going into this experience I was quite nervous.\nI stuck to my guns and went with an idea that I had the past summer which was a website that helps students analyze their financial aid package based on information about the school, similar to how Niche.com grades colleges and universities.\nI ended up finding a partner who didn't know much about web development, but was willing to work with me in developing this idea.\nThis was my first foray into handling large amounts of data and trying to contextualize it for a user. If I were to fix one thing about the site, it would be effectively distinguishing the grades between each other so that a user's result is crystal clear.",

    longDescription:
      "When joining this endeavor, I knew very little about cannabis and the business surrounding it. The extent of my knowledge went as far as knowing Jim Belushi became a huge grower and that's pretty much it.\nI was brought on to work as a front-end developer and to help construct the interface for a website that tracks cannabis strain availability in the Pennsylvania area.\nI knew HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React at this time but the project required me to learn and understand Django. To make this a nonissue, I went ahead and learned all I could about how MVCs work and how a REST API can be built with Django.\nMy goal for the site's frontend was for it to be pleasing, yet recognizable as far as its theme and function. I ended up learning a whole lot with this project including how the pharmaceutical cannabis industry works, user authentication, the transfer of data from backend to frontend, and much more.",
